* There are three main components: Camera, Prediction, and StaticImage. 
The Camera, which runs in `components/camera/Camera.tsx` is responsible for displaying a live full screen view of the user's selected webcam. 
The Prediction component `components/prediction/Prediction.tsx` is the box in the lower left hand corner, and is responsible for displaying the top prediction results and their confidences.
The StaticImage component `components/staticImage/StaticImage.tsx` displays an image selected from the file picker and runs it through the model from a canvas element.
